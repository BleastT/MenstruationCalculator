# MenstruationCalculator

DISCLAMER: This program is more of a programming experiment than a real menstruation calculator so it should not be used for serious purposes. The dates displayed in it are based on calculations that we learned at school and therefore may be inaccurate in some cases.

This desktop app was made using Python and tkinter. It calculates the next menstruation, 
the ovulation date and the fertility window based on the menstrual cycle of the user.
